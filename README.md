# Facial Key-Point Detection Model
Uses ResNet18 pre-trained network layers and with the help of transfer learning, the model is capable to detect facial keypoints.
The dataset used in this model is the Facial Keypoint Detection dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection)
