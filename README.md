# Facial Key-Point Detection Model
Uses ResNet18 pre-trained network layers and with the help of transfer learning, the model is capable to detect facial keypoints.
The dataset used in this model is the Facial Keypoint Detection dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection)

## Applications
AI_Avatar_Generation.ipynb utilizes a more complex version of the facial keypoint detection model for adding facial gestures to a static image, creating realistic motions. This project is reverse-engineering the idea behind Synthesia.io
